# simple-product

A monorepo for managing a basic product management system, built with a modern stack:

- **Frontend**: Angular (project name: `product-dashboard`)
- **Backend**: Spring Boot (project name: `product-service-api`)

This setup aims to provide a clear separation of concerns while keeping both frontend and backend projects organized within a single repository.
